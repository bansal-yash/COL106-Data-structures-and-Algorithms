 ABBAS, I got your letter. What you have said about the mal is clear enough, but I think I shall understand it fully only when I read the letter a second time. I have preserved the letter. Describe to me your experiences in jail. What did you read, how much did you spin and card and in what spirit did you observe the prison rules? How was your health? If you have any views to express about the method of carding which Mathuradasbhai is persuading people to adopt, please do so.
