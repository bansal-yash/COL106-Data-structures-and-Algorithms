 1 According to the addressee, the contents of this letter were conveyed to Shri Aurobindo through Mother, and Shri Aurobindo wrote in pencil on the note saying : You will have to write that I am unable to see him because for a long time past I have made it an absolute rule not to have any interview with anyonethat I do not even speak with my disciples and only give silent blessings to them three times a year. All requests for an interview from others I have been obliged to refuse. The rule has been imposed on me by the necessity of my sadhana and is not at all a matter of convenience or anything else. The time has not come when I can depart from it.
