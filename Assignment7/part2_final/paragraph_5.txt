 But, may I ask what proof (which must be positive and undisputed) can you put forth regarding the existence of a God? Hindu philosophers or ancient rishis 3, it seems to me, in their attempt to describs the swarupa or reality of Ishwara have at last come to the conclusion that He is indescribable and veiled in maya and so on.... I do not dare to deny that a true Mahatma like you or Sri Aurobindo, or the Buddha and Sankaracharyas of the past, may well conceive and realize the existence of such a God, who is far beyond the reach of ordinary human intellect.
