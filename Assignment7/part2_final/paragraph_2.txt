 1 According to the addressee, he communicated the contents of this letter to Mother and inquired if it was true that Gandhiji had asked for at least a line in Shri Aurobindos hand; and Shri Aurobindo has written a full letter in his own hand which he does not usually do. In reply, Shri Aurobindo wrote in pencil on the note : Yes, I wrote to him a short letter explaining the nature of my retirement and regretting that I could not break my rule as long as the reason for it existed. It was addressed to Bangalore, I believe, and ought to have reached him, unless it has been pocketed by the C.I.D. I suppose even if he had left Banaglore it would have been forwarded to him. You can write and inform him of the fact.
